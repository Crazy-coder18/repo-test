However, understanding its fundamentals offers insight into how server-side scripting revolutionized dynamic web applications. Developed by Microsoft, Classic ASP was introduced in 1996 as part of Internet Information Services (IIS) for Windows. It allowed developers to create server-side webpages that could dynamically update based on user interactions or backend data.</p> <p>This blog explores the basics of Classic ASP, walks through its architecture, presents a simple example, and highlights use cases where its legacy persists. Let\u2019s jump in!</p>"},{"location":"ASP/#what-is-classic-asp","title":"What is Classic ASP?","text":"<p>Classic ASP stands for Active Server Pages and is a server-side scripting environment. Its key feature is enabling web pages to include dynamic content by blending HTML with server-side scripts like VBScript or JScript (Microsoft's variant of JavaScript). </p> <p>Key characteristics of ASP: 1. Dynamic Scripting: Executes code on the server and sends HTML output to the browser. 2. State Management: Offers session and application handling for persistent data. 3. Access to Databases: Integrates with databases like Microsoft Access and SQL Server via ADO (ActiveX Data Objects). 4. Client-Side Independence: Outputs plain HTML, making ASP compatible across all browsers.  </p> <p>It predates modern frameworks such as ASP.NET but serves as the precursor for Microsoft\u2019s web development ecosystem.</p>"},{"location":"ASP/#how-does-asp-work","title":"How Does ASP Work?","text":"<p>The process of an ASP-based application can be explained through these steps:</p> <ol> <li>User Request: A user requests an <code>.asp</code> file via the browser. For example, <code>http://example.com/index.asp</code>.  </li> <li>Server-Side Script Execution: The web server (IIS) processes the ASP code within the file, dynamically generating HTML based on logic and/or database queries.  </li> <li>Response to Client: The server sends the finalized HTML to the user\u2019s browser.  </li> </ol> <p>Example: Suppose a page displays the current time using Classic ASP. The server dynamically inserts the current timestamp into the HTML before sending it to the user.</p> <p>Here\u2019s a code snippet:  </p> <pre><code>&lt;%\n  Dim currentTime\n  currentTime = Time() ' Fetches the current server time\n%&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to Classic ASP!&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;The current time is: &lt;%=currentTime%&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Upon execution, the <code>&lt;%=currentTime%&gt;</code> placeholder is replaced by the server with the current time (e.g., <code>12:45 PM</code>), which is then sent as plain HTML to the client.</p>"},{"location":"ASP/#key-features-in-classic-asp","title":"Key Features in Classic ASP","text":""},{"location":"ASP/#1-mix-of-html-and-scripts","title":"1.
