## What Is Microsoft Purview?

Microsoft Purview (formerly Azure Purview) is a **unified data governance and compliance platform**. It helps organizations understand their data estates by enabling automated data discovery, sensitive data classification, and end-to-end visibility into data systems.

It encompasses a suite of tools not only for governing data but also for ensuring compliance across organizational assets. Microsoft Purview bridges multiple Azure services to manage both structured and unstructured data effectively, regardless of where it resides.

## Core Features of Microsoft Purview

Let’s explore the must-know features of Microsoft Purview that help organizations manage and govern data effectively:

### 1. **Data Map**
The Purview Data Map provides a foundation for discovering and organizing data. It automatically scans and catalogs data across diverse sources, such as Azure Data Lake, SQL Server, Amazon S3, Oracle, and even on-premises systems.

- **Example Use Case:**
  Imagine a retail organization storing customer transaction data in an Azure SQL Database, operational data in Oracle, and sales reports in Amazon S3. With Purview Data Map, the company can catalog all datasets in one place, ensuring a single source of data truth.

  ```csharp
  // Automated data scanning example in Purview
  public async Task ScanDataSource(string dataSourceType)
  {
      var purviewClient = new PurviewClient();
      await purviewClient.ScanDataSourceAsync(sourceType: dataSourceType);
  }
  ```

### 2. **Data Catalog**
A robust data cataloging tool enables users to access data *with confidence*. Purview's data catalog promotes a self-service environment by showing metadata information, lineage, and sensitivity labels. This ensures stakeholders have the right data in the right context at the right time.

- **Real-Life Example:**
  If a data analyst requires a sales report from the past quarter, they can easily browse the catalog. Instead of hunting across disparate sources, they trust Purview’s consolidated metadata to locate the file.

---

### 3. **Data Classification and Labeling**
Microsoft Purview uses AI models to **classify** sensitive data, such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or financial records. More than 200 pre-built data classifiers make it easy to safeguard data and achieve compliance.

- **Practical Scenario:**
  A healthcare provider must ensure compliance with HIPAA regulations when storing patient information. Purview can classify data fields like "social security numbers" or "insurance IDs," applying protection policies wherever required.

---

### 4. **Data Lineage**
Data lineage displays how data flows through an organization over time. Purview tracks data from its origin to its ultimate use, helping users understand dependencies, impacts, and relationships.

- **Example:**
  Consider an energy company analyzing data pipelines from their IoT sensors to Azure Data Factory. Purview provides a visual representation of the lineage, showcasing how data transforms at each stage. If something breaks, troubleshooting becomes seamless.

---

### 5. **Sensitive Data Monitoring**
Purview integrates tightly with Microsoft Information Protection (MIP) to apply sensitivity labels consistently, monitor sensitive data usage, and ensure compliance.

---

### 6. **Regulatory Compliance Insights**
For businesses bound by legal frameworks such as GDPR, CCPA, or HIPAA, Purview provides **regulatory compliance insights**. It maps detailed actions and processes to frameworks, reducing risk exposure.

---

### 3. **Risk Mitigation**

---

### 4. **Automated Discovery for Scalability**
