## What is Microsoft Purview?

Microsoft Purview is a comprehensive suite of solutions designed to help businesses manage their data governance and compliance. Formerly known as Azure Purview, it goes beyond traditional governance solutions by integrating closely with Microsoft 365 and Azure ecosystems, along with other third-party tools and environments, to provide end-to-end visibility and control.

Whether you’re a business managing sensitive data, ensuring compliance with regulations like GDPR, or trying to extract insights from a vast data landscape, Microsoft Purview has something to offer.

## Key Features of Microsoft Purview

### 1. **Data Discovery and Classification**
Understanding where your data resides and what type of information it holds is the cornerstone of governance. Microsoft Purview provides robust data discovery capabilities by scanning your entire data estate, both on-premises and in the cloud. 

#### Example: Classifying Sensitive Data
Imagine a financial institution that processes mountains of customer data daily. Purview can scan your datasets and classify Personally Identifiable Information (PII), such as credit card numbers or Social Security numbers. 

```JSON
{
  "DataDetail": "Customer Data",
  "Category": "Sensitive",
  "Tags": ["PII", "CreditCard", "Compliance"],
  "Properties": {
    "Owner": "Finance Team",
    "RetentionPolicy": "3 Years"
  }
}
```
The above classification ensures your organization knows where sensitive data resides and can implement the appropriate measures to protect it.

### 2. **Unified Data Lineage**
Tracing the origin and flow of data is essential for transparency. Data lineage in Purview provides a visual map showing how data moves across your environment. This highlights dependencies and transformations, helping stakeholders trust the data.

#### Real-Life Scenario:
A pharmaceutical company developing a new drug needs to comply with strict regulatory standards. Using Purview's data lineage feature, they can answer critical compliance questions such as:
- Where did this set of patient trial data originate?
- How was the data transformed during analysis?

By having a clear lineage, organizations can enhance accountability and trust across teams.

### 3. **End-to-End Data Governance and Compliance**
Purview automates compliance efforts by providing insights into regulatory requirements and adherence. It supports frameworks like GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA, among others.

#### Code Snippet: Setting Up Compliance Scans for Azure Storage
```PowerShell
# Example: Automating data scanning in Azure storage
Import-Module Az.Purview

$PurviewAccount = "YourPurviewAccountName"
$ScanName = "GDPRCompliance"

# Schedule a compliance scan
Start-AzPurviewScan -AccountName $PurviewAccount `
                    -ScanName $ScanName `
                    -Recurrence "Weekly"
```

With such capabilities, global enterprises can ensure their policies are automatically enforcing compliance with minimal manual intervention.

### 4. **Microsoft 365 Integration**
Microsoft Purview seamlessly combines data governance with the tools employees already use, such as Word, Excel, and Teams. This integration allows users to classify documents, emails, and other records without disrupting productivity.

#### Example in Action:
An HR team shares employee performance reviews via Teams. Purview can automatically label these documents as confidential, restricting access to unauthorized participants.

- **Step 1:** Purview flags sensitive content.
- **Step 2:** Automated policies block sharing or require approval.
- **Step 3:** Logs are maintained for audit trails.

### 5. **Purpose-Built Governance Portal**
The consolidated Purview governance portal offers a single location for managing all aspects of data governance, from data scanning and classification to monitoring compliance risks.
